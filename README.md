# HTTP File Transmitter

HTTP File Transmitter allows a local directory to be monitored, transmitting it&#39;s files to a folder on a remote system for processing. The local system runs the transmitter (client) and the remote system runs the receiver (server). After transmission, files on the local system are deleted.
